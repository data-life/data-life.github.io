      <title>The Split Brain Problem</title>

      <description>The Problem Consider a two node cluster that contains one index with a replication factor of one. This means that each shard of data in the index resides on one node and is replicated to the other node. One of these nodes is elected the master of the cluster to handle administrative tasks and it holds the primary shard for the index. What happens when there is a break in communication between the two nodes for whatever reason?</description>

      <title>Predictable IP For Your Master Node</title>

      <description>The Problem Sometimes you are looking to be able to specify both the public and the private IP for an EMR cluster when it launches. This allows you to not have to change any existing infrastructure, while still being able to decommission an EMR cluster whenever it is needed and provision a new one. Currently you are able to attach an EIP to the master instance, but this does not solve the issue for private clusters and is cumbersome if clusters are constantly being provisioned/decommissioned.</description>

      <title>Supported EMRCluster Node Types</title>

      <description>The Problem Data Pipeline supports instances that use Instance Storage, not EBS volumes. EMR clusters support both. These two worlds collide when you try to use Data Pipeline to launch an EMR cluster since your nodes will need to support instance storage.
The Solution Since this can be a mission to figure out, the following are instance types categorized according to optimizations that have instance storage and are supported by EMR.</description>

      <title>Use Powershell to find the best Spot Instance</title>

      <description>How do you find the best value for money Spot Instance Sometimes you are just looking for the cheapest way to do something in AWS. Initially you look at spot instances, but realistically you need a monster machine to achieve what you are looking to do. Either your task is CPU or Memory intensive and so you look at using spot prices for one of the larger AWS instances. Assuming this task you are looking to achieve can be run using a cluster on EC2 or one that supports spot instances, it turns out that the best value for money is not always the largest instance types.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a Cluster Configuration Change in Elasticsearch</title>
      <link>https://data-life.github.io/post/elasticsearch/clusterconfigurationchanges/</link>

      <description>When ever any change has been made to an AWS Elasticsearch cluster, whether it is changing the instance type for your data nodes, adding master nodes or changing an access policy, there is a process that happens in the background that should be understood before a change is commited so you can understand how a change can affect your cluster.
The first step that happens in Elasticsearch will provision a new cluster with your new configuration.</description>
